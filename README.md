# Hi! Iâ€™m Sebastian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I specialize in working with React, but I have a soft spot for JavaScript-based frameworks that enable the creation of efficient and scalable solutions.
I am always striving to improve my skills by staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and implementing modern technologies. I have a soft spot for clean and readable code, as well as teamwork, which allows us to create innovative and valuable products.
